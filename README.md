Andrea Paredes - ML Model Implementation and Optimization:
Using clean merged data I selected 4 features that I believed would be the most relevant to train my model. After encoding and making sure all columns format were correct, I started experimenting and got bad results from inittial models, with 0.13 R-squared score.
Added Linear Regression and later Random Forest Regression. The Random Forest gave me a 0.81 R-squared score. Having this as my base, I moved to train a neural network model that initially improved very little with a 0.23 R-squared. After adding many new feature columns, layers and neurons the best score I was able to reach was 0.78 R-squared.
Unfortunately, since too much time was spent training a model with the goal to reach at least 0.80 R-squared, I was not able to work on deploying the model to our website.
